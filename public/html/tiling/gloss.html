	<dt>(v, e, t)-tiling</dt>
	<dd>A <em>(v, e, t)-tiling</em> is a tiling that is <em>v</em>-isogonal, <em>e</em>-isotoxal, and <em>t</em>-isohedral for finite values <em>v</em>, <em>e</em>, and <em>t</em>.</dd>

	<dt>adjacent</dt>
	<dd>Two tiles are <em>adjacent</em> if they have an edge in common. Similarly, two edges are adjacent if they have a common endpoint and two vertices are adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge.</dd>

	<dt>class of element</dt>
	<dd>The vertices, edges, and tiles of a tiling are three <em>classes of elements</em>.</dd>

	<dt>edge</dt>
	<dd>Since any two tiles have disjoint interiors, the intersection of a set of tiles is either empty or consists of isolated points and arcs. In these cases the arcs will be called <em>edges</em> of the tiling. The requirement that the tiles are topological disks also implies that an edge cannot contain a vertex other than its endpoints; i.e. there are no vertices in the relative interior of an edge.</dd>

	<dt>edge figure</dt>
	<dd>An <em>edge figure</em> is the union of an edge and the edges adjacent to it. Two edges are then 'locally equivalent' if they have congruent edge figures.</dd>

	<dt>edge-homogeneous</dt>
	<dd>If the symmetries of a tiling can take any edge onto any other edge which has a congruent edge figure, the tiling is <em>edge-homogeneous</em>.</dd>

	<dt>edge-to-edge</dt>
	<dd>If the tiles are polygons, what we normally think of as edges and vertices of the polygons may not correspond to edges and vertices of the tiling. If they do, the tiling is said to be <em>edge-to-edge</em>.</dd>

	<dt>endpoint</dt>
	<dd>The requirement that the tiles be topological disks implies that the intersection of a set of tiles cannot contain a closed curve, hence an edge connects two distinct points, called its <em>endpoints</em>. For reasonable tilings these endpoints are vertices of the tiling.</dd>

	<dt>element</dt>
	<dd>The vertices, edges, and tiles of a tiling are the <em>elements</em> of the tiling.</dd>

	<dt>equivalent</dt>
	<dd>We say that two elements are <em>equivalent</em> if there is a symmetry of the tiling taking one to the other.</dd>

	<dt>incident</dt>
	<dd>The word <em>incident</em> is used to denote the relation of a tile to each of the edges or vertices it contains, and also of an edge to each of its endpoints; the relation of incidence is considered to be symmetric.</dd>

	<dt>isogonal</dt>
	<dd>A tiling T is <em>isogonal</em> if there is a symmetry taking any vertex to any other. Isogonal is also referred to as "uniform" by some authors, especially in the case where the tiles are all regular polygons.</dd>

	<dt>isohedral</dt>
	<dd>A tiling T is <em>isohedral</em> if there is a symmetry of T taking any tile to any other.</dd>

	<dt>isotoxal</dt>
	<dd>A tiling T is <em>isotoxal</em> if there is a symmetry taking any edge to any other.</dd>

	<dt>isometry</dt>
	<dd>An <em>isometry</em> is a distance preserving mapping of the Euclidean plane to itself. Two tilings are viewed as equal if one tiling may be made to coincide with the other by an isometry followed by a change of scale. Thus any two tilings by congruent regular hexagons are equal, and we may refer to "the" regular tiling by regular hexagons.</dd>

	<dt>k-gonal</dt>
	<dd>If every vertex figure of T is congruent to one of <em>k</em> vertex figures, T is <em>k-gonal</em>, and <em>monogonal</em> if it is 1-gonal.</dd>

	<dt>k-hedral</dt>
	<dd>If every tile of T is congruent to exactly one of <em>k</em> fixed tiles (and <em>k</em> is minimal with this property), then T is <em>k-hedral</em>.</dd>

	<dt>k-toxal</dt>
	<dd>If every edge of T has an edge figure congruent to one of <em>k</em> fixed, incongruent edge figures, then T is <em>k-toxal</em>, and T is <em>monotoxal</em> if <em>k</em> = 1.</dd>

	<dt>k-isogonal</dt>
	<dd>A tiling is <em>k-isogonal</em> if there are exactly <em>k</em> orbits of vertices.</dd>

	<dt>k-isohedral</dt>
	<dd>A tiling is <em>k-isohedral</em> if there are exactly <em>k</em> orbits of tiles.</dd>

	<dt>k-isotoxal</dt>
	<dd>A tiling is <em>k-isotoxal</em> if there are exactly <em>k</em> orbits of edges.</dd>

	<dt>monohedral</dt>
	<dd>If all the tiles in a tiling T are congruent, T is <em>monohedral</em>.</dd>

	<dt>neighbor</dt>
	<dd>Two tiles are <em>neighbors</em> if their intersection is non-empty.</dd>

	<dt>orbit</dt>
	<dd>The set of elements equivalent to a fixed element of T is the <em>orbit</em> of that element.</dd>

	<dt>periodic</dt>
	<dd>If the symmetry group of T contains two translations in non-parallel directions, T is called <em>periodic</em>. Periodic tilings can be described in terms of their translations.</dd>

	<dt>period parallelogram</dt>
	<dd>For a periodic T, if we fix any point of the plane, then the image of that point under all translations of T will form a lattice and these points may be thought of (in many ways) as the vertices of a (different) tiling by parallelograms. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the superimposed parallelogram tiling, the "pattern" formed by the tiles, edges, and vertices of T within any one parallelogram is congruent to the pattern within any other parallelogram. The parallelograms which are tiles of such a tiling are known as <em>period parallelograms</em>.</dd>

	<dt>realizable</dt>
	<dd>A set of parameters <em>(v, e, t)</em> is <em>realizable</em> if there is a <em>(v, e, t)</em>-tiling.</dd>

	<dt>reasonable tiling</dt>
	<dd>A <em>reasonable tiling</em> is one that does not contain any singular points.</dd>

	<dt>representative set</dt>
	<dd>A <em>representative set</em> of vertices is a set of vertices which contains exactly one vertex from each orbit; representative sets of edges and tiles are defined analogously.</dd>

	<dt>singular point</dt>
	<dd>Points such that every open neighborhood of the point intersects infinitely many tiles.</dd>

	<dt>symmetry</dt>
	<dd>A <em>symmetry</em> of a tiling T is an isometry that maps every tile of T to a tile of T. A symmetry automatically maps edges to edges and vertices to vertices.</dd>

	<dt>symmetry group</dt>
	<dd>The set of all symmetries forms a group under composition, referred to as the <em>symmetry group of T</em>.</dd>

	<dt>tile</dt>
	<dd>A <em>tiling</em> T of the Euclidean plane is a family of closed topological disks, called <em>tiles</em>, which cover the plane without gaps or overlaps. "Without overlaps" means that the interiors of any two tiles are disjoint.</dd>

	<dt>tile-homogeneous</dt>
	<dd>If the symmetries of a tiling can take any tile onto any other tile congruent to it, the tiling is <em>tile-homogeneous</em>.</dd>

	<dt>valence</dt>
	<dd>Every vertex is the endpoint of some number of edges, and this number is the <em>valence</em> of the vertex. For reasonable tilings this valence is at least 3.</dd>

	<dt>vertex</dt>
	<dd>Since any two tiles have disjoint interiors, the intersection of a set of tiles is either empty or consists of isolated points and arcs. In these cases the points will be called <em>vertices</em> of the tiling.</dd>

	<dt>vertex figure</dt>
	<dd>A <em>vertex figure</em> is the union of a vertex and the edges incident with it. Two vertices are then <em>locally equivalent</em> if they have congruent vertex figures.</dd>

	<dt>vertex-homogeneous</dt>
	<dd>If the symmetries of a tiling can take any vertex onto any other vertex which has a congruent vertex figure, the tiling is <em>vertex-homogeneous</em>.</dd>
