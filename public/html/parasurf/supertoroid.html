<h2>Supertoroid</h2>

<p>The supertoroid (or supertorus/superdonut) is based on the
<a href="/#maths/parasurf?torus">torus</a> but raises the sin and cosine components
to powers. It was first described and named by Alan Barr in 1994.</p>

<h3>Parameterization</h3>

<p>$$\begin{align}
x& = \cos^{\alpha} u \:(R + r\cos^{\beta} v)&	u \in [-\pi,\pi)\\
y& = \sin^{\alpha} u \:(R + r\cos^{\beta} v)&	v \in [-\pi,\pi)\\
z& = R\sin^{\beta} v                        & \alpha,\beta \in [0.1,4)\\
\end{align}$$</p>
