What Becomes of the Brokenhearted (November 2013)	On November 23rd last year (2012) this broken heart was mended by an NHS team at London Heart. And just in the nick of time apparently. I can't praise the care I received throughout the process too highly or thank the friends and family that supported me too much. This MNM is just a way to mark the day so that it doesn't slip by unnoticed.
