Minimalism and Modern Classical (October 2008)	Every October the Star joins in with Mole Valley's Arts Alive festival so I usually tried to do something a little bit different for my October nights. This is the first one I did and is very arty! It's also shorter than most as I showed a video at the end of Pink Floyd performing Echoes at Pompeii to mark the recent death of Richard Wright.
